#### Comment 1 (Lines 86-97)
- **Type**: actionable
- **Severity**: major

**Comment:**
```
**Potential array bounds issue in build_context.**

Line 93 slices `@tokens[@pos..@pos+5]` without checking if `@pos+5` exceeds the array bounds. This could raise an error in edge cases or return a partial/nil result at the end of the token stream.

Apply a bounds-safe slice:

```diff
  def build_context
    {
      current_token: current,
      previous_token: @last_token,
      position: @pos,
-     remaining_tokens: @tokens[@pos..@pos+5]
+     remaining_tokens: @tokens[@pos...[@pos+6, @tokens.length].min]
    }
  end
```
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
experimental/cpp_ast_v3/CODE_IMPROVEMENTS.md around lines 86 to 97: the slice @tokens[@pos..@pos+5] can exceed the array bounds at the end of the token stream; change it to a bounds-safe slice by computing a safe end index (min(@pos+5, @tokens.length - 1)) before taking the range, or use a length-based slice (e.g. start, count) which returns fewer elements instead of raising — update the build_context method to use one of these safe approaches so remaining_tokens never indexes past the array.
```

#### Comment 2 (Lines 37-45)
- **Type**: actionable
- **Severity**: minor

**Comment:**
```
**Incomplete code example in Phase 1.**

The `parse_function` example lacks a return statement, making it unclear what the function should return. This could confuse developers implementing the actual fix.

Revise the example to show a complete, working implementation:

```diff
  def parse_function
    return_type = parse_type
    name = parse_identifier
    params = parse_parameters
    body = parse_expression
    
    # Remove unused variable
    # previous = @last_token  # <-- Remove this line
+   
+   Function.new(return_type, name, params, body)
  end
```
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/CODE_IMPROVEMENTS.md around lines 37 to 45, the parse_function example is incomplete because it never returns a value and leaves an unused commented variable; update the snippet to construct and return a function AST node (e.g., build a hash/object or language-specific AST node containing return_type, name, params, and body) and remove the unused previous variable line so the example clearly shows the final returned value and usable implementation.
```

**Suggestions:**
- def parse_function
  return_type = parse_type
  name = parse_identifier
  params = parse_parameters
  body = parse_expression
  
  # Remove unused variable
  # previous = @last_token  # <-- Remove this line
  
  Function.new(return_type, name, params, body)
end

#### Comment 1 (Lines 71-85)
- **Type**: actionable
- **Severity**: minor

**Comment:**
```
**Inconsistent error type inheritance across phases.**

Phase 1 defines `AuroraError` as the custom error class, but Phase 3 raises `TypeError` instead. Either `TypeError` should inherit from `AuroraError`, or Phase 3 should raise `AuroraError` (or a subclass like `AuroraTypeError`).

Clarify the error class hierarchy and ensure consistency. For example:

```ruby
class AuroraTypeError < AuroraError
  # Type-specific error logic
end
```

Then use `raise AuroraTypeError.new(...)` in Phase 3 instead of `raise TypeError.new(...)`.
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/ERROR_HANDLING_IMPROVEMENTS.md around lines 71 to 85, Phase 3 currently raises Ruby's TypeError which is inconsistent with Phase 1's custom AuroraError; define a subclass (e.g. AuroraTypeError) that inherits from AuroraError and contains any type-specific fields/logic, then replace the raise TypeError.new(...) in Phase 3 with raise AuroraTypeError.new(...) (and update any constructor arguments or handlers to accept the new class); also update any documentation/comments to reflect the clarified error hierarchy.
```

#### Comment 2 (Lines 41-69)
- **Type**: actionable
- **Severity**: major

**Comment:**
```
**Missing edge case handling in error recovery.**

The `recover_from_error` method (line 62-67) skips to the next declaration boundary, but doesn't handle the case where EOF is reached without finding a boundary token. Additionally, advancing `@pos` directly bypasses token validation and may leave the parser in an inconsistent state if tokens between boundaries are malformed.

Consider safeguarding the recovery:

```ruby
def recover_from_error
  # Skip to next declaration boundary
  while !eof? && current.type != :FN && current.type != :TYPE
    @pos += 1
  end
  
  # If no boundary found before EOF, reset to a safe state
  @pos = tokens.length if eof?
end
```

Also clarify whether internal token consumption (lines 64-65) needs validation or error callbacks.
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/ERROR_HANDLING_IMPROVEMENTS.md around lines 41 to 69, the recover_from_error implementation fails to handle reaching EOF and advances @pos directly which can leave the parser in an inconsistent state; change recovery so that when the loop exits you explicitly clamp @pos to tokens.length (or an equivalent safe sentinel) if eof? was reached, and replace direct @pos increments with a validated token-consumption helper (or call the parser's existing consume/advance method) that performs bounds checks and optional error callbacks so internal token state remains consistent.
```

#### Comment 1 (Lines 48-73)
- **Type**: actionable
- **Severity**: major

**Comment:**
```
**Establish baseline metrics before setting performance thresholds.**

The performance thresholds (1.0s parser time, 50MB memory) appear arbitrary without baseline measurements or justification. Before finalizing Phase 2, recommend:

1. Running benchmarks on the current implementation to establish baseline metrics
2. Documenting the test environment (CPU, RAM, OS)
3. Setting thresholds based on acceptable degradation (e.g., "no more than 10% slower than baseline")

Additionally, the memory measurement approach using `get_memory_usage()` is fragile and OS-dependent. Consider using a proper memory profiling library or tool (e.g., Valgrind, system profilers) for reliable measurements.


I can help design a baseline measurement and thresholding strategy if needed.
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
experimental/cpp_ast_v3/TESTING_IMPROVEMENTS.md around lines 48 to 73: The current Phase 2 test hardcodes thresholds (1.0s, 50MB) without baselines or environment details and uses a fragile get_memory_usage approach; update the document and tests to first run and record baseline metrics for the current implementation (parser time and peak memory), record the test environment (CPU, RAM, OS, compiler/build flags), and store baselines in a versioned baseline file or CI artifact; change thresholding to be relative (e.g., fail if >10% slower or >10% more memory than baseline) and update the sample test to read thresholds from that baseline/config rather than hardcoded values; replace or augment get_memory_usage with a recommended cross-platform profiler or tool (or instruct CI to run Valgrind/heap profiler on Linux/macOS equivalents) and document how to reproduce baseline measurements locally and in CI.

**Comment:**
```
**Document missing DSL functions and methods used in examples.**

The examples section uses several functions and methods not documented in the API reference:

1. **Line 274**: `namespace()` - used but not documented in the C++ AST DSL section
2. **Line 294**: `expr_stmt()` - used but not documented in the Statement DSL section  
3. **Line 301, 319**: `.to_source()` - method called on AST/program objects but not documented as an available method
4. **Line 316**: `Aurora.lower_to_cpp()` - used but not documented in Core Functions section

These omissions make the examples difficult to follow for users trying to learn from them.


Add these missing functions to the appropriate sections, or if they are not yet implemented, use different examples that only reference documented APIs.
```

#### Comment 1 (Lines 60-86)

- **Severity**: major

**Comment:**
```
**Naming conflict with Ruby's built-in error classes.**

Defining `Aurora::SyntaxError`, `Aurora::TypeError`, and `Aurora::ImportError` creates risky naming conflicts with Ruby's built-in `::SyntaxError`, `::TypeError`, and `::ImportError` classes. If code includes the `Aurora` module (`include Aurora`), these custom classes shadow Ruby's standard exceptions, which can break rescue clauses and cause subtle bugs.

Consider renaming these classes to avoid conflicts:


```diff
-  class SyntaxError < EnhancedError
+  class AuroraSyntaxError < EnhancedError
     def initialize(message, location: nil, suggestion: nil, context: nil)
       super(message, location: location, suggestion: suggestion, context: context, error_type: :syntax)
     end
   end
   
-  class TypeError < EnhancedError
+  class AuroraTypeError < EnhancedError
     def initialize(message, location: nil, suggestion: nil, context: nil)
       super(message, location: location, suggestion: suggestion, context: context, error_type: :type)
     end
   end
   
-  class ScopeError < EnhancedError
+  class AuroraScopeError < EnhancedError
     def initialize(message, location: nil, suggestion: nil, context: nil)
       super(message, location: location, suggestion: suggestion, context: context, error_type: :scope)
     end
   end
   
-  class ImportError < EnhancedError
+  class AuroraImportError < EnhancedError
     def initialize(message, location: nil, suggestion: nil, context: nil)
       super(message, location: location, suggestion: suggestion, context: context, error_type: :import)
     end
   end
```

Alternatively, use more distinctive names like `ParseError`, `TypeCheckError`, `ScopeResolutionError`, and `ModuleImportError`.
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
experimental/cpp_ast_v3/lib/aurora/error_handling/enhanced_errors.rb lines 60-86: the custom exception class names conflict with Ruby core exceptions; rename them to non-conflicting, descriptive names (for example replace SyntaxError → ParseError, TypeError → TypeCheckError, ScopeError → ScopeResolutionError, ImportError → ModuleImportError), keep them inheriting from EnhancedError and preserve the location/suggestion/context parameters and error_type symbols (adjust error_type names if you prefer more descriptive symbols), then update all internal references, rescue clauses, tests and documentation to use the new class names.
```

**Comment:**
```
**Avoid direct manipulation of parent class instance variables.**

Directly incrementing `@pos` breaks encapsulation and assumes implementation details of the parent `Parser` class. If the parent changes its position tracking mechanism, this will break.



Consider adding a protected method to the parent `Parser` class:

```ruby
# In parser.rb
protected

def skip_token
  @pos += 1
end
```

Then update this method:

```diff
 def recover_to_next_declaration
   # Skip tokens until we find a declaration boundary
   while !eof? && !declaration_start?
-    @pos += 1
+    skip_token
   end
 end
```
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/lib/aurora/parser/error_recovery_parser.rb around lines 104 to 109, avoid directly manipulating the parent Parser's @pos; instead add a protected advancement method in the parent Parser (e.g. protected def skip_token; @pos += 1; end) and then replace direct @pos increments in recover_to_next_declaration with calls to that method (or an existing public/protected advance/next_token method) so the subclass uses the parent's API for moving the parse position.

**Qualify error class names to avoid catching Ruby built-in exceptions.**

Lines 117 and 124 check for `SyntaxError` and `TypeError` without namespace qualification. This will match Ruby's built-in `::SyntaxError` and `::TypeError` instead of Aurora's custom error classes, potentially mishandling Ruby-level errors.

**Cache clearing method is never called.**

`clear_cache_if_needed` is defined but never invoked, so the caches (`@memo` and `@expression_cache`) grow unbounded throughout parsing. This could lead to memory issues on large files.

#### Comment 2 (Lines 63-70)

**Comment:**
```
**Critical: Cache key omits the `left` parameter.**

The cache key only includes `@pos` and `min_precedence`, but not the `left` operand. If `parse_binary_expression` is called with the same position and precedence but different `left` AST nodes, it will incorrectly return a cached result that doesn't account for the different left operand, producing an invalid AST.



Since `left` is an AST node that can't be easily serialized into a cache key, this caching strategy is fundamentally flawed. Consider removing caching from this method:

```diff
-def parse_binary_expression(left, min_precedence = 0)
-  cache_key = "#{@pos}_binary_#{min_precedence}"
-  return @expression_cache[cache_key] if @expression_cache[cache_key]
-  
-  result = parse_binary_expression_impl(left, min_precedence)
-  @expression_cache[cache_key] = result
-  result
-end
-
-def parse_binary_expression_impl(left, min_precedence)
+def parse_binary_expression(left, min_precedence = 0)
   while current.type == :OPERATOR && precedence(current.value) >= min_precedence
     op = current.value
     consume(:OPERATOR)
```
```

```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/lib/aurora/parser/optimized_parser.rb around lines 63 to 70, the current cache key for parse_binary_expression uses only @pos and min_precedence and omits the left AST node which makes cached results incorrect for different left operands; remove the caching from this method by deleting the cache_key generation, the early return that reads @expression_cache[cache_key], and the assignment that writes @expression_cache[cache_key] so the method simply calls and returns parse_binary_expression_impl(left, min_precedence); if caching is still desired later, redesign it to include a stable identity for left (e.g., object_id) and verify correctness across different left nodes.

**Critical: Freezing the buffer breaks reusability.**

Calling `@buffer.freeze` causes a critical bug. The `@string_builder` instance is shared across multiple `generate` calls, and after the first call to `to_s`, the frozen buffer cannot be modified by subsequent `append` operations, resulting in `FrozenError`.



Fix by returning a duplicate instead of freezing:
```diff
 def to_s
-  @buffer.freeze
+  @buffer.dup
 end
```

Or if freezing is desired for safety:
```diff
 def to_s
-  @buffer.freeze
+  @buffer.dup.freeze
 end
```
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**

**Clarify control flow: ambiguous test expectations.**

The test has confusing control flow with assertions in both the `begin` and `rescue` branches. If `MultipleErrors` is raised at line 60, `result` won't be assigned and line 62 won't execute. The test should clarify whether it expects the parser to:
1. Return a result containing partial AST despite errors, OR
2. Raise `MultipleErrors` with some parsed declarations accessible through the exception



If the parser raises exceptions but includes partial results in the exception object, consider this pattern:

```diff
-    begin
-      result = parser.parse
-      # Should still parse the working function despite the error
-      assert result.declarations.any? { |decl| decl.name == "working" }
-    rescue Aurora::Parser::MultipleErrors => e
-      # Should have errors but still parse some declarations
-      assert e.errors.length > 0
-    end
+    error = assert_raises(Aurora::Parser::MultipleErrors) do
+      parser.parse
+    end
+    
+    assert error.errors.length > 0, "Should capture errors"
+    # If partial results are available on the exception:
+    assert error.partial_ast.declarations.any? { |decl| decl.name == "working" }, 
+      "Should parse working function despite errors"
```

In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/test/aurora/enhanced_error_handling_test.rb around lines 49-67, the test mixes assertions in the normal and rescue paths causing ambiguity if Aurora::Parser::MultipleErrors is raised (result will be unassigned). Update the test to unambiguously express the expected behavior: either (A) assert parser.parse returns a result containing the partial AST and remove the rescue, or (B) expect a MultipleErrors exception and, inside the rescue, extract any partial result from the exception (e.g., e.partial_result or e.result) and assert the "working" declaration is present; if the exception class does not expose partial results, change the test to only assert that errors are raised and separately test successful partial AST behavior in another spec.

**Hard time assertions are flaky and environment-dependent.**

The assertion `parse_time.real < 1.0` will fail on slower CI machines, under system load, or in resource-constrained environments. Performance benchmarks should typically report metrics for trend analysis rather than enforcing hard time limits.

Consider either:
- Removing the assertion and using this purely for reporting
- Making the threshold configurable via environment variable
- Using a much more generous threshold that catches only catastrophic regressions

**Memoization cache lifecycle not managed; potential memory leak.**

The `@memo` dictionary is initialized in `initialize` but never cleared between parsing sessions. For long-running processes or when parsing multiple files, this cache will grow indefinitely and consume memory. Add a mechanism to clear or bound the cache (e.g., max entries, LRU eviction, or clear-on-parse).


Additionally, the memoization key (line 32) uses only position and operation type. Ensure that parser state mutations (e.g., changes to lookahead, mode flags) don't invalidate cached results.

**Invalid Ruby syntax: `String.new` does not accept a `capacity` parameter.**

Line 64 uses `String.new(capacity: initial_capacity)`, but Ruby's String constructor does not support a capacity parameter. This looks like Python or Java syntax. The correct approach in Ruby is to allocate a buffer using a different pattern or use `String.new(initial_capacity)` (which allocates a string of that length, not capacity).


Consider one of these alternatives:

```ruby
# Option 1: Pre-allocate using String multiplication (simplest for Ruby)
@buffer = ""

# Option 2: Use a StringBuilder pattern from a gem like 'stringio'
@buffer = StringIO.new

# Option 3: Use a simple String and let Ruby's dynamic sizing handle it
@buffer = String.new
```

**IMPORT declarations should not appear after other declarations.**

Allowing IMPORT statements to be parsed after functions and types (line 86 in the main declaration loop) is unusual and likely indicates a logic error. Imports are typically only allowed at the beginning of a file, which is already handled by the dedicated import parsing loop (lines 53-60).



Consider removing this case or adding validation:

```diff
 when :TYPE
   declarations << parse_type_decl
-when :IMPORT
-  imports << parse_import_decl
 else
   add_syntax_error("Unexpected token: #{current.type}")
   recover_to_next_declaration
```
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/lib/aurora/parser/error_recovery_parser.rb around lines 85–86, the main declaration loop still accepts :IMPORT tokens (imports << parse_import_decl) even after other declarations have been parsed; remove that branch or enforce validation so IMPORTs cannot appear after non-import declarations. Fix by either (a) deleting the when :IMPORT case from the main loop so imports are only handled by the dedicated import parsing loop earlier, or (b) add a simple check/flag that detects if any non-IMPORT declaration has already been parsed and, if an IMPORT is found afterwards, raise a parse/syntax error (with a helpful message) instead of accepting it.

**Refactor error handling logic.**

This method has several issues:

1. **Broad exception handling**: Line 26 uses `rescue => e` which catches all exceptions including system errors (NoMemoryError, SignalException, etc.). This should catch only StandardError or specific parser exceptions.

2. **Duplicate logic**: The MultipleErrors raising logic is duplicated (lines 23 and 28).

3. **Unnecessary complexity**: The rescue block re-raises the original exception when @errors is empty, which could be simplified.



Apply this diff to improve the error handling:

```diff
 def parse
   @errors.clear
-  @recovery_points.clear
   
-  begin
-    result = parse_program_with_recovery
-    if @errors.any?
-      raise MultipleErrors.new(@errors)

**Critical: Cache clearing method is never invoked.**

The `clear_cache_if_needed` method is defined but never called anywhere in this class. Without invoking it, the caches (`@memo` and `@expression_cache`) will grow unbounded during parsing, potentially causing memory issues on large files.



You should call this method at appropriate points in the parsing flow. Consider adding it to methods that advance the parser position:

```ruby
def consume(expected_type)
  if current.type == expected_type
    @last_token = current
    @pos += 1
    clear_cache_if_needed  # Add this line
    @last_token

    raise ParseError, "Expected #{expected_type}, got #{current.type}"

**Critical: Cache key must include the `left` operand.**

The cache key only uses `@pos` and `min_precedence`, but the method also takes a `left` parameter that affects the result. Different left operands at the same position will incorrectly return the same cached result, producing wrong AST nodes.

For example, if parsing "A + B + C", when the method is called with different left operands at the same position, the cache will return incorrect results.



The correct fix is to avoid caching this method entirely, since the `left` parameter can vary:

```diff
-def parse_binary_expression(left, min_precedence = 0)
-  cache_key = "#{@pos}_binary_#{min_precedence}"
-  return @expression_cache[cache_key] if @expression_cache[cache_key]
-  
-  result = parse_binary_expression_impl(left, min_precedence)
-  @expression_cache[cache_key] = result
-  result
-end
-
-def parse_binary_expression_impl(left, min_precedence)
+def parse_binary_expression(left, min_precedence = 0)
   while current.type == :OPERATOR && precedence(current.value) >= min_precedence
     op = current.value

**StringBuilder clearing pattern breaks nested generation.**

Multiple generation methods clear `@string_builder` (lines 65, 88, 139), but these methods are called from within `generate_class_optimized` which builds up a class declaration incrementally. For example:

2. Line 77: Calls `generate_member_optimized` for each member
3. Line 139: `generate_variable_optimized` clears the buffer again, destroying the class being built

**Caching by object_id may return stale results if AST nodes are mutated.**

The cache key uses `ast.object_id`, which identifies the object by reference rather than by content. If an AST node is mutated after its first generation, subsequent calls will return the original cached output instead of reflecting the changes.



Consider one of these approaches:
- If ASTs are immutable, document this assumption clearly
- If ASTs can be mutated, implement a content-based cache key (e.g., hash of relevant attributes)
- Add a cache invalidation mechanism

**Template cache logic is broken - returns incorrect class names.**

The template cache has two critical issues:

1. **Line 62 vs Line 66 mismatch**: Line 66 builds the template using the actual `klass.name`, but line 62 attempts to replace `"CLASS_NAME"` placeholder that was never inserted. The `gsub` will never match, causing cached templates to return the wrong class name for subsequent classes.

2. **Insufficient cache key**: The key `"#{klass.name}_#{klass.members.length}"` (line 60) doesn't account for member types or content. Two classes with the same name and member count but different members will incorrectly share a cache entry.



Apply this diff to fix the placeholder issue:

```diff
       @string_builder.clear
-      @string_builder.append("class #{klass.name}")
+      @string_builder.append("class CLASS_NAME")
```

Additionally, reconsider whether template caching provides value given the complexity of properly keying by all relevant class attributes (members, inheritance, etc.).

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/lib/cpp_ast/builder/optimized_generator.rb around lines 58 to 85, the template cache logic is broken: the cached template never contains the "CLASS_NAME" placeholder (so gsub at line 62 never matches) and the cache key only uses klass.name and member count so different classes collide. Fix by building and caching a template that includes a "CLASS_NAME" placeholder instead of inserting klass.name directly when composing the template, then on cache hit perform gsub("CLASS_NAME", klass.name) to produce the final text; also expand the cache key to include deterministic summaries of members and inheritance (for example a joined string of member signatures and inheritance) so templates are only reused for truly identical class shapes, or remove caching if accurate keying is impractical.
```

**Suggestions:**
-       def generate_class_optimized(klass)

**Clarify expected behavior and test logic.**

The test has ambiguous control flow with two possible paths (success at line 60 vs. exception at line 63), but doesn't clearly specify which should occur. This makes the test non-deterministic.

Decide whether `ErrorRecoveryParser.parse` should:
- Return a partial AST with errors stored separately (test the return value)
- Raise `MultipleErrors` after recovery (test only in rescue block)



Consider restructuring to explicitly test the expected behavior:

```diff

-      assert result.declarations.any? { |decl| decl.name == "working" }

**Meaningless assertion doesn't verify memory efficiency.**

The `assert true` on line 91 always passes and doesn't validate anything. The test only verifies that no exceptions are raised during parsing, which is already implicitly tested by the absence of test failures. Consider either:

1. Measuring actual memory usage before/after and asserting it stays within bounds, or
2. Removing this test if memory leak detection is better handled by external profiling tools

**Hard-coded time thresholds cause brittle tests.**

```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/test/performance/simple_benchmark.rb around line 88, the assertion uses a hard-coded threshold `parse_time.real < 2.0` which makes the test brittle; change it to a configurable threshold (e.g., read a numeric ENV var like PARSE_TIME_LIMIT or a constant at top of the file) or remove the timing assert entirely; if making configurable, parse ENV['PARSE_TIME_LIMIT'] to a Float with a sensible default (e.g., 2.0) and use that variable in the assertion so CI or different machines can override the limit.

**Comment:**
```
**Hard-coded time thresholds cause brittle tests.**

The assertion `parse_time.real < 1.0` will fail on slower machines, overloaded CI systems, or when running under a debugger. Consider making the threshold configurable via an environment variable, significantly increasing it, or removing the assertion entirely if this is purely informational benchmarking.
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/test/performance/simple_benchmark.rb around line 54, the hard-coded assertion assert parse_time.real < 1.0 is brittle; replace it with a configurable threshold read from an environment variable (e.g. PARSE_TIME_THRESHOLD) with a sensible, larger default (for example 5.0), parse the ENV value to a Float with fallback and validation, and use that variable in the assertion (or make the check conditional/skip if an env flag indicates "informational only"); ensure non-numeric or missing ENV values fall back to the default so the test remains stable across machines.

**Hard-coded time thresholds cause brittle tests.**

Same issue as the parsing test: `gen_time.real < 1.0` is brittle and can cause flaky failures. Consider making it configurable or removing it.
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/test/performance/simple_benchmark.rb around line 72, the test uses a brittle hard-coded threshold `gen_time.real < 1.0`; make the threshold configurable and the assertion message informative: read a float threshold from an environment variable (e.g. ENV['GEN_TIME_THRESHOLD']) with a sensible default (1.0), optionally allow skipping via an env flag for CI or slow-run scenarios, then assert using that threshold and include both the threshold and actual time in the failure message.

#### Comment 4 (Lines 32-32)

**Comment:**
```
**Performance assertions can cause flaky tests.**

Asserting that one approach is faster than another can fail non-deterministically due to system load, garbage collection, or other environmental factors. Consider removing this assertion or using a more lenient approach (e.g., allowing a margin or running multiple samples).
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/test/performance/simple_benchmark.rb around line 32, the test currently asserts builder_time.real < regular_time.real which is flaky; change it to either remove the strict performance assertion or make it robust by running multiple iterations for each approach, taking the median (or mean after outlier removal), and asserting with a tolerance (e.g., builder_time_median <= regular_time_median * 0.90) or require a statistically significant difference; alternatively simply log the times and avoid a hard pass/fail on performance.

**Use `<<` instead of `+=` for string concatenation in loop.**

This method uses `+=` for repeated string concatenation, which creates new string objects on each iteration. This is inefficient and contradicts the lesson from `test_string_builder_performance`. Use `<<` for better performance.

Apply this diff:

```diff
     function_count.times do |i|
-      source += <<~AURORA
+      source << <<~AURORA
         fn function_#{i}(x: i32) -> i32 =
           if x > 0 then x * 2
           else 0
       AURORA
     end
```
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```
In experimental/cpp_ast_v3/test/performance/simple_benchmark.rb around lines 100 to 106, the loop uses `source += <<~AURORA` which repeatedly reallocates strings; change the concatenation to use the mutating append operator `<<` (i.e. `source << <<~AURORA`) inside the loop so the string is appended in place, preserving the heredoc content and improving performance.

**Guard against division by zero.**

If `builder_time.real` is extremely small or zero (possible on very fast machines or with timing precision issues), this will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`.

```
```

**Code Generation Instructions:**
```

```

**Suggestions:**
